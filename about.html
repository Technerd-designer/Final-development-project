            Atlas library is one of the biggest prides of our community.In 2016,members of the community came together and formed an organization,mostly comprising of teachers, parents and our local leaders.This organization was formed 
            after we realized that our own young people lacked access to quality reading material.We then realized that part of the problem was the poor state of the library, which not only had few books available, but those available were outdated
            and torn.
        </p>

            Seeing as upgrading the education standards of our children was one of our top priorities,we came together and came up with a concept for a new,state of the art library. With contributions from our members,three years later,in 2019,
            this concept became the full blown reality that we see today!
